# Js_HTML_CSS_to-practice

I'm a full-stack dev focused in back-end, so my front-end is realy poor.

A repository that I will use to save my frequent studies in Js, HTML and CSS. So, there are some wrong and poor scripts, and a good code, just search.

I'll make a project like a portifolium to save the mini projects.
